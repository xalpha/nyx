monkey.obj and monkey.obj are subdivided versions of the monkey mesh found in Blender.

Blender is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL, or “free software”).

This license grants people a number of freedoms:

    You are free to use Blender, for any purpose
    You are free to distribute Blender
    You can study how Blender works and change it
    You can distribute changed versions of Blender

The GPL strictly aims at protecting these freedoms, requiring everyone to share their modifications when they also share the software in public. That aspect is commonly referred to as Copyleft.

The Blender Foundation and its projects on blender.org are committed to preserving Blender as free software.
